## Key Points

- The Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered compliance platform combining Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Claude API integration, and SQLite database to continuously monitor regulatory changes and automate compliance analysis
- The system implements a 7-stage orchestration pipeline (Initializing → Retrieving Sources → Detecting Changes → Analyzing → Scoring → Generating Artifacts → Finalizing) that runs asynchronously in the background after users configure scans
- Change detection uses content hashing (SHA-256), keyword pattern matching, and demo mode flagging to identify material regulatory updates before AI analysis
- Claude AI analyzes detected changes to determine regulatory relevance, assign impact levels (Low/Medium/High/Critical), generate executive summaries, and flag items requiring human review based on confidence scores below 0.7
- The workflow system guides items through Draft → In Review → Verified stages, ensuring proper governance and documentation with audit trails
- The Knowledge Store provides searchable archival of verified regulatory changes with filtering by impact level, date range, and domain/jurisdiction for organizational compliance reference
- Professional Word document artifacts are automatically generated for each analysis, eliminating manual report creation and enabling immediate export for compliance committees and audits

## Entities and Topics

- **ScanOrchestrator**: Central coordinator managing the 7-stage pipeline, handling state transitions, error recovery, and real-time status updates
- **ChangeDetectionService**: Identifies material changes using SHA-256 hashing, regex-based keyword detection, and demo mode flagging
- **LLMService**: Integrates with Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model) for structured regulatory analysis with prompt engineering establishing compliance expertise
- **ArtifactGenerator**: Creates markdown artifacts stored in database and professional Word documents (.docx) saved to artifacts/ directory
- **Mock Regulatory Sources**: Four demonstration documents including FinCEN CDD Amendment, FinCEN SAR Advisory, OCC Transaction Monitoring Guidance, and Federal Reserve AML Procedures
- **Workflow Management**: Multi-stage review process with status transitions, comments, timestamps, and audit trail maintenance for governance
- **Knowledge Store**: Searchable archive of verified items (workflow_status = "verified") with keyword search, filtering, and export capabilities
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS providing dashboard, scan configuration, results review, and workflow management interfaces
- **Backend API**: FastAPI application handling scan creation, result storage, artifact management, and data retrieval
- **SQLite Database**: Stores scan records, analysis results, workflow status, confidence scores, review flags, and audit trail data

## Relevance to Project
